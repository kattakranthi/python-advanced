Dividend yield is a financial ratio that represents the annual dividend income an investor can expect to receive from an investment, typically expressed as a percentage of the investment's current market price. It is often used to assess the income potential of dividend-paying stocks or investments.

The formula for calculating dividend yield is:

Dividend Yield
=
Annual Dividend per Share
Stock Price per Share
×
100
%
Dividend Yield= 
Stock Price per Share
Annual Dividend per Share
​
 ×100%

Here are a couple of examples to illustrate dividend yield:

Example 1: Dividend Yield for a Stock

Suppose you have a stock from Company XYZ, and it pays an annual dividend of $2 per share. The current market price of one share of XYZ stock is $40.

Using the formula, you can calculate the dividend yield as follows:

Dividend Yield
=
Annual Dividend per Share
Stock Price per Share
×
100
%
=
2
40
×
100
%
=
5
%
Dividend Yield= 
Stock Price per Share
Annual Dividend per Share
​
 ×100%= 
40
2
​
 ×100%=5%

So, the dividend yield for XYZ stock is 5%. This means that for every $100 invested in XYZ stock (at the current market price), you can expect to receive $5 in annual dividends.

Example 2: Comparing Dividend Yields of Two Stocks

Let's compare the dividend yields of two different stocks, ABC and DEF.

ABC stock pays an annual dividend of $3 per share, and its current market price is $60 per share.
DEF stock pays an annual dividend of $2.50 per share, and its current market price is $75 per share.
Using the formula, we can calculate the dividend yields for both stocks:

For ABC stock:
Dividend Yield (ABC)
=
3
60
×
100
%
=

%
Dividend Yield (ABC)=

For DEF stock:
Dividend Yield (DEF)

Dividend Yield (DEF)=

​
 ×100%≈33.33%

In this comparison, ABC stock has a dividend yield of 5%, while DEF stock has a higher dividend yield of approximately 33.33%. This suggests that, based on their current market prices and dividend payments, DEF stock offers a higher annual income relative to its market price compared to ABC stock.

Investors often consider dividend yield when evaluating investments, as it provides insights into the income potential of a stock or other dividend-paying assets. However, it's essential to keep in mind that a higher dividend yield may not always indicate a better investment, as other factors like the company's financial health and growth prospects should also be considered.
