'''
A generator in Python is a special type of iterable that allows you to iterate over a sequence of values without having to store them all in memory at once. This is particularly useful when dealing with large datasets or when generating values on the fly. Generators are defined using functions with the yield keyword
'''
def simple_generator():
    yield 1
    yield 2
    yield 3

gen = simple_generator()

for value in gen:
    print(value)
