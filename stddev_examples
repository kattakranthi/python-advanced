'''
Median -- A list of array numbers is given. A Median is sum of all the list of numbers and length of the numbers
Standard deviation -- Standard Deviation is how deviate is the numbers from median of the number.
Variation --- get the difference of each value from the median, square all the values and add . And divide that value with total length of values
Standard deviation is a square root of variation.
